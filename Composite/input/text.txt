    This is the first sentence.
    Does this sentence end with the question mark? Yes. And here are our dots...
    Now it's time for listing!
    //:
    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("Hello, world!");
        }
    }
    //:~
    Now - several sentences for sorting by wordsCount test. Two words.
    Happy three words. Four absolutely senseless words.
    Five words just for test. Six words probably is too many.
    By the way, we can have dots inside sentences: Main.java.
    In our case comparing two words is case-sensitive.
    Newline at the end of file is essential.
